    "### Why?\n",
    "* Allows you to keep a comprehensive record of all changes made during a project. This is very useful if you later make a change that breaks something as you will be able to track bugs down much faster!\n",
    "* Keeps a backup of files - this is useful if need to e.g. recreate some data (like a plot) that was made several months ago, as can easily 'rewind' code back to the state it was back then\n",
    "* Also allows you to make changes without worrying about breaking something (e.g. using branches)\n",
    "* If working in a group project, helps prevent different members of the group overwriting each others' changes (can merge multiple versions and use conflict resolution), can keep record of who wrote what\n",
    "* No need for millions of different versions of files named e.g. `version_1.txt`, `version_2.txt`, ..., `version_27.txt`, `FINAL_version.txt`, `FINAL_FINAL_version.txt`, `FINAL_FINAL_PRINT_version.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "* [git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular tool for local version control\n",
    "* Alternatives: [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) (SVN), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)...\n",
    "* Online tools for hosting repositories such as [github](https://github.com/), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/), [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/)"
