    "### Why?\n",
    "* So you've written a set of tests for your code, you run them and everything passes - great! However, you then go back to work on your code and quickly forget about testing it. Eventually, a few months later after implementing several new features you remember to try testing your code again. You run the set of tests, only to find that they fail \n",
    "* Solution: continuous integration.\n",
    "* This will run your tests for you regularly (e.g. every night, every time you push changes to a repository) and report back to you the results\n",
    "* Can now spot (almost) instantly when code breaks \n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "* Several tools out there: `travis.ci`, `jenkins.ci`, `circle.ci`\n",
    "* Involve writing a short script which details the computational setup (i.e. any libraries needed) and what code should be run to execute tests"

    "### Why?\n",
    "* So you have a test suite and you're using continuous integration to run it regularly\n",
    "* However, how do you know that you are testing all parts of your code? It's all very well to test a few auxilliary functions, but if you're not testing the main part of the code then you still cannot trust the results\n",
    "* Solution: code coverage\n",
    "* This will track what parts of the code are being run when tests execute and will highlight areas not currently being tested\n",
    "* Generally want to aim for > 90% code coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "* There exist libraries for most languages that will produce code coverage reports, e.g. `coverage.py` for python, `gcov` for C/C++, `tcov` for C/C++/fortran\n",
    "* Can use tools like Codecov to integrate these tools with continuous integration, providing an easy-to-use interface to analyse code coverage and keep track of code coverage as develop code\n",
    "* These tools are also particularly useful if code is written in multiple languages, as will combine reports produced for each of the different languages"
