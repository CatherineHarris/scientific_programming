    "### Why?\n",
    "* Simply: why should someone trust your code if they have no idea how it works?\n",
    "* In experimental sciences, experiments must be reproducible: give a description of the apparatus and experimental setup, it should be possible for someone else to replicate results.\n",
    "* Similarly, for computational sciences, given the algorithm and information about how it's been implemented in your code, it should be possible for someone else to write their own code and replicate your results.\n",
    "* It should also be possible for a new user to be able to read and understand what your code is doing without any extra explanation from you\n",
    "* You should be able to look back at code you wrote weeks/months/years ago and still understand how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "* Always write your code as if someone else is going to be using it at a later date. No matter how small the project may be at the start, often it will turn into something much bigger / be incorporated later on into another project\n",
    "* Useful for code to be to some extent 'self-documenting' - e.g. classes, functions and variables given sensible, descriptive names that make it clear what they are doing\n",
    "* Tools such as `sphinx` and `doxygen` will generate documentation for you from docstrings and annotations\n",
    "* Services such as `Read The Docs` will host repository's documentation and work with version control/continuous services to recompile when push changes \n",
    "* Tools such as python's `doctest` will allow you to write tests which can then be easily incorporated into documentation"
