    "## Why should I document my code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is a part of software development that is often overlooked. In the rush to produce results, it can seem like a waste of time writing documentation when you could instead be fixing bugs or adding new features. However, good documentation is vital for good code: why should someone trust your code is producing the correct results if they have no idea how it works? \n",
    "\n",
    "In experimental science, experiments must be reproducible. The apparatus and experimental setup must be described in enough detail that an independent group can replicate any results. Detailed descriptions of testing are given to demonstrate that the apparatus are performing as designed and so any new results can be trusted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computational science, we should aim for similar standards. The algorithm and its implementation should ideally be described in enough detail for someone who does not have access to the original source code to implement it themselves and reproduce your results. Tests should be described to demonstrate the functionality of the code and show it is performing as described. \n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation also helps other users of the code. It's likely that at some point you will want to show or give your code to someone else. If it's well documented, this will allow other people to read and understand what your code is doing without you having to sit down with them and explain everything in person. "

    "Finally, documentation will help you be a more effective software developer. If you are working on the same code for any length of time, it is very easy to forget how parts of it you wrote weeks/months/years ago work. By taking the time to comment your code, briefly explaining how it works and why you made certain choices (e.g. of algorithm, data structure), it will save you a lot of time down the line."

    "Bad documentation is almost as useless as no documentation at all: to be useful, documentation must be easy to navigate, clear and concise yet informative.

    "Different programming languages have different documentation conventions and standards. For python, a good standard to follow is that used by the [`numpy` and `scipy` documentation](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt). This helps produce documentation that is clear and concise, and it can be used in combination with `sphinx` (provided the `numpydoc` extension is used). Docstrings and can be written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html), enabling the use of e.g. lists, tables, hyperlinks and laTeX maths expressions. "

    "## Automating documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are tools out there that can take a lot of the work out of documenting your code. They can take information from the source code itself, including comments within the code, and turn this into clear, well-structured documentation. Two commonly used tools are [`sphinx`](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and [`doxygen`](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). Sphinx is good for python projects, doxygen for C++ projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools can then be linked to a [`Read The Docs`](https://readthedocs.org/) account. This will host the repository's documentation and, much like the continuous integration tools of the previous section, can be configured to rebuild the documentation every time changes are pushed so that it is kept up to date with the latest versions of your code.

The configuration file contains information about the sphinx setup including the values you gave when quickstart-ing your project - for now you will probably want to leave this alone as well, but there are a lot of parameters in there that can be customised if you so wish. The master document is the index file for your documentation. It normally contains a brief introduction to the project and a table of contents linking to the other pages of the documentation.
